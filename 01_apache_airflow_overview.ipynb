        "\n",
        "A DAG specifies the dependencies between Tasks, and the order in which to execute them and run retries; the Tasks themselves describe what to do, be it fetching data, running analysis, triggering other systems, or more."

        "- An executor, which handles running tasks. In the default Airflow installation, this runs everything inside the scheduler, but most production-suitable executors actually push task execution out to workers.\n",
        "- A webserver, which presents a handy user interface to inspect, trigger and debug the behaviour of DAGs and tasks.\n",
        "- A folder of DAG files, read by the scheduler and executor (and any workers the executor has)\n",
        "- A metadata database, used by the scheduler, executor and webserver to store state."
