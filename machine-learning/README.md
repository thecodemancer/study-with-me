## Overview of Machine Learning

### Welcome to machine learning!

#### What is Machine Learning?

- It's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Examples

- Google Search, Bing, Baidu
- Picture labeling on Instagram, Snapchat
- Movie recommendation
- Voice to text to write a text message
- Siri, play a song!
- Ok Google, show me Indian restaurants near me
- Spam detector in emails
- Wind turbine power generation optimization
- Diagnosis maker in hospitals
- Defect detector in assembly lines

#### Why is Machine Learning so widely used today?

We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the interesting things, such as:

- Perform a web search
- Recognize human speech
- Diagnose diseases from X-rays
- Building a self-driving car

#### What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?

Machines as intelligent as you and me

### Applications of machine learning

"I find it hard to think of any industry that machine learning is unlikely to touch in a significant way now or in the near future"

Sectors

- Retail
- Travel
- Transportation
- Automotive
- Materials
- Manufacturing

Because of the massive untapped opportunities across so many different sectors, today there is a vast unfulfilled demand for this skill set.
